## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 27
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* More Jira usage
We don’t have a mark for sprint 3, however, as we wanted during the plan last sprint our burndown chart is much better than last time. Along with that, we were able to visualize what was done and what still needed to be done as a group much better.

* More online meetings
We had one longer mid sprint meeting to discuss the project direction halfway through which also helped us stay more organized along with the Jira and standups. We also had a few pair coding sessions in smaller groups to deal with bugs and merge conflicts which helped us solve issues more easily.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.


* Jira scoring
We relatively successfully used Fibonacci for the scoring, however, we underestimated the difficulty of some of the larger tasks. As a group we agreed 5 was ideally the ceiling for a user story, but some of the things we gave a 5 were probably bigger and could’ve been broken down into more subtasks.

* Burndown chart is not perfect
In the last section we said the burndown chart was better, and it was, but that was compared to sprint 2 in which we marked all the tasks as done on the last day and caused our burndown chart to be very imbalanced. Compared to the ideal curve shown on Jira, we could’ve done better.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

1. Waitlist (23) - Darren
   
We encountered a bug we were not able to fix in time. We decided we would finish it in sprint 4

2. Group Chat (25) - Mustafa

It is similar to the individual chat and we underestimated Friends

3. Keeping track of registered events (11)
   
This is outside of sprint 3 but we are adding it here since we noticed it during the review. Our originally planned dashboard was a bit different and we would have a calendar along with this, but we decided to push back the calendar and merge the above story with the dashboard. Due to some clerical error in sprint 2 we forgot to remove it after editing the other story (13). Technically, it is completed. 

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. Drop the calendar since it isn't really adding anything
2. Work towards cleaning up UI
