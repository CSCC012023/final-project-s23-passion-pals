# Product Name: PassionPals

#### Q1: 

We are planning to build a web application called “PassionPals” that connects people with similar interests and provides access to enjoyable and rewarding activities that users can engage in with other users, fostering meaningful connections along the way.

The problem we aim to solve is the constant struggle to meet people with similar interests and passions and find exciting events/activities. For instance, someone may want to attend an event like a concert, however they don’t know anyone they can attend it with who also enjoys the event. Another example includes someone who wants to explore their interests and find new events they can attend, but don’t know how to go about it. Our platform attempts to solve these issues by giving users access to a variety of fun activities and a way to quickly interact with others who share their interests.

Our product will be a website that offers access to exciting and rewarding experiences. It will provide a fun environment where individuals can connect with others who share their interests and engage in new adventures. Users will be able to create event posts as well as enroll in other users’ events. By subscribing to categories that align with their interests and enrolling in captivating events, users can participate in a wide range of activities that cater to their preferences with other users. 

The categories we have that users can subscribe to are the following:

Group Outings: 
Casual fun activities for a group of people to do together, such as attending concerts, escape rooms etc.

Adventure Buddies: 
Thrilling activities such as hiking, rock climbing, skydiving etc.

Culture: 
Cultural experiences such as cultural events, festivals etc

Learning Communities: 
Educational events such as workshops, seminars, cooking classes etc

Wellness and Fitness: 
Wellness and fitness events such as yoga or meditation sessions, sports events etc 




#### Q2: 

The target users for our product are young adults (18+) seeking new experiences and wanting to create meaningful relationships with like-minded people. This is our target audience, as young adults generally enjoy meeting new people, participating in various activities and exploring their interests.

#### Q3:

Users today, to discover activities to partake in, use social media/social media groups(i.e. Facebook groups) for specific topics they are interested in, their personal network, internet articles/blog websites or sites such as Eventbrite. In the case of social media groups, there is usually too much going on, making it relatively inefficient for people just looking to connect and partake in planned activities with people. Whereas PassionPals’ primary focus is to help individuals who want to meet like-minded people connect and discover exciting opportunities. It also provides a more organized structure for planning events.

Similarly, the internet and blog websites must be more time-consuming to browse through and usually have access to only mainstream events. Comparatively, due to PassionPals’ feed design, users can seamlessly view events that align with their passions and access a much more diverse range of events as users can create personal events they would not find on the internet.

Although websites like Eventbrite are also catered to providing users with a platform to find events, it does not allow for communication between users. PassionPals has a messaging system that will enable users to connect personally, which enhances the entire experience and allows people to make meaningful connections.

Self-discovery and exploration are essential components of personal development as a young adult. Our product provides opportunities to effortlessly explore new passions in recognition of this. With our user-friendly interface and wide range of events, young adults are enticed to use our product to embark on a journey of self-discovery and seamlessly indulge in their interests. 
The main benefit PassionPals offers users is allowing them to discover new information about various events. Users can learn about events they might not have known about through PassionPals. The platform presents users with opportunities they may need to look into or notice by curating a wide range of activities across numerous categories. This is useful to users as PassionPals gives them a wide range of options, which opens up endless opportunities and encourages them to discover new interests. PassionPals also helps users save time by giving them access to a single platform where they can look up and explore a variety of events and activities. As a result, users may quickly find exciting events that match their interests, all in one spot, without spending hours searching via multiple sources. This is useful to users as they can spend more time enjoying and indulging in their interests and less time struggling to find activities and companions. Additionally, PassionPals offers a personalized recommendation feed of events tailored to the user’s specific preferences, which allows users to discover activities that genuinely resonate with them, ensuring a great experience. 

PassionPals allows users to subscribe to multiple themes that are of interest to them. They are then recommended events in their feed based on their location, friend enrollment, and subscribed themes. Once the user finds an event of their liking, they can enroll in it and get ready to have a great time! If the user cannot find an event they would like to partake in on the website, they can easily create a new event on PassionPals and wait for others to join. This website structure satisfies the needs of all users who will sign up for our platform. For instance, look at one of our personas from question 2, Nishu.

PassionPals fits Nishu’s needs as the website will allow her to subscribe to the “Adventure Buddies” theme. After doing this, she will be recommended events in her feed that are near her inputted location and fall under the Adventure Buddies theme. If she still can’t find her desired events in the feed, she can use the search feature to see if any adventurous events are taking place. If the search returns such events, she can enroll and have a great time with like-minded individuals! Even if such an event does not exist, Nishu can quickly create an event and wait for others to enroll. 


#### Q4:

For our team, “DONE” indicates that the feature in question is fully functional, performs as intended, and meets all requirements outlined by the team during the planning process. It also means that the feature has been thoroughly tested to ensure that it is accurate and that it can be seamlessly integrated into the rest of the project.

### Highlights

During our planning process, we analyzed current popular social platforms to gain insight into the features and functionalities of our application. We learned a lot about user preferences and expectations from examining successful components in other platforms. Additionally, we had internal talks and tried to imagine what the perfect product would be like from the user's viewpoint. Being a member of the intended audience helped us make informed decisions aligned with their preferences. 

Decision Point 1: Recommendation Algorithm

Alternatives discussed: 
We initially thought to display all of the events in the user's location in no specific order so that users can access whatever event they want. However, we decided against that idea because we wanted the feed to be more personalized. Instead, we created a filter component so that the users would still have access to all events but have the default be a recommended algorithm that shows a more tailored feed of events.

Conclusion: 
We chose a combination recommendation system integrating subscribed categories, user preferences, and friend event enrollments to produce customized event suggestions. With this strategy, we can create a tailored experience that matches each user's preferences and interests, resulting in greater user engagement and enjoyment.


Decision Point 2: Dashboard view

Alternatives discussed: 
Multiple events in each row would allow users to go through more events faster. However, we decided against that idea as it does not allow for sufficient information to be presented, due to the lack of space, for users to make a quick judgement about whether they are interested or not. 

Conclusion: 
Since it is well known and easy to navigate, we adopted a post-feed structure (1 event in each row) that resembles many social media platforms. This enables users to swiftly become accustomed to the platform and engage with posts intuitively, promoting a smooth user experience.

Decision Point 3: Automatic group chat component after enrollment into an event

Alternatives discussed: 
Creating a forum-like structure where participants can post and reply to discussions with pagination may be better than scrolling to read previous discussions before a user enrolled in the event. However, this approach needs real-time communication and quick coordination, especially for time-sensitive events.

Conclusion: 
We chose to implement a group chat component for enrolled events as it allows participants to instantly connect and engage in real-time conversations, facilitates coordination, and enables members to ask questions and quickly receive responses.

Decision Point 4: Calendar Component

Alternatives discussed: 
An alternative we discussed was a list view instead that would list the events in order of the most recent date to the latest, as it is a simple and clean way to see upcoming events. However, we decided against this as a list would become tedious to look through if the user enrolls in a large number of events. Additionally, it doesn't provide a visual representation of the distribution of the events.

Conclusion:
We chose the calendar component because we found that many users prefer a visual representation of the dates/distribution of events to compare/plan easily with the rest of their schedules.


Team Organization:
We used Agile Methodology (Scrum) to organize the team and Jira to create user stories. We made a server on Discord because it provided easy communication between group members, as team meetings/discussions were just one click away. We met in a discord call 2-3 times a week to plan the details of the product, discuss technical challenges, create user stories, give feedback and assign responsibilities.
