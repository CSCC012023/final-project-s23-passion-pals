# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 6th, 2023
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Code Reviews
We were able to catch bugs and errors early on, which resulted in higher-quality code, and reduced the chances of running into a lot of merge conflicts down the road
Allowed us to discuss the coding standards and style guidelines we will be adhering to, so we could achieve a consistent codebase.
* Jira
Utilized the user story point system to allow for better estimation and planning
We were able to track the progress of user stories throughout the sprint, as we could set the status of each story to "To Do," "In Progress," or "Done."
We defined and assigned user stories to specific sprints, which helped organize work, set priorities, and allocate tasks within the team.
* Frequent Standups
We were able to identify and address challenges early on
Maintained a shared understanding of the project goals

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Coding sessions
We decided to plan a coding session where all of the team members would come together in person to work on their respective tasks and features collaboratively
But due to some conflicting schedules and commitments, it was challenging to find a suitable time for everyone to participate in the coding session 
The limited attendance in the coding session reduced collaboration and hindered progress during the session
* Jira Scoring
We used a 1-10 scale for points on Jira. Going forward we will use the fibonacci method to adhere more to industry standards.
Because of our timeline we ended up finishing everything near the end of the sprint which caused our Burndown Chart to be very unbalanced.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* In the previous sprint our goal was to be more active on Jira which was true to an extent, but due to our self imposed shorter timeline most of our stories were finished in the final days and the burndown chart did not look ideal. This sprint we will continue to improve our Jira usage and aim to have a better burndown chart.

* We will switch from 1-10 scoring to Fibonacci for user story estimates as it is closer to industry standard and we believe it will be more simple.



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Associate created event with user
Did not get to it

* As a user, I would like to be able to delete events I created so that I can remove any unnecessary or outdated events from the system and ensure accurate information for other users.
Required the first one to be finished

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Continue to improve our usage of Jira so that we adhere more to industry standards.
* Improve frontend for most pages.
