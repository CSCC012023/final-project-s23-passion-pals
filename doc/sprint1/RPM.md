#Release Planning Meeting - Sprint 1


##Release Goal:
The goal is to have the signup/login process done and begin working on the main part of the project. For this sprint we’d like to have the profile page and edit profile page working and parts of the event page done.


##Scope:
In simple terms, we will complete the following.
* Implement login backend, which verifies email and password
* Implement signup backend, which creates an account on the database given their first name, last name, email, and password
* Finish the frontend for login and signup
* Create a useable backend and frontend for user profile page, which should allow users to review their account information
* Create an edit profile page corresponding with the profile page, which should allow users to edit their account information
* Create basic back and frontend add event page, which allows users to create an event and save it on the database
* Get started on event details


##They will correspond with the following user stories we agreed on in sprint 0.
* As an unregistered user, I would like to sign up using my name, email, username, and password so that I can create an account.(Mustafa back-end and basic front-end)
* As an registered user, I would like to login using my email and password so that I can access my account(Mustafa back-end and basic front-end)
* As a user, I would like to reset my password so that if I forget it, I can still have access to my account
* As a user, I would like to access the settings page to edit my profile information, including my name, email, password, and user image, so that I can customize and update my personal details according to my preferences.
* As a user, I would like to view event thumbnails with optional images, titles, themes, time/date, location, short descriptions, and the number of spots left so that I can quickly browse through events and make informed decisions about which ones to explore further
* As a user, I would like to be able to leave events so that I can manage my participation and remove myself from activities I no longer wish to attend
* As a user, I would like to create an event with all the necessary details so that I can organize and invite others to participate in an activity or experience.
