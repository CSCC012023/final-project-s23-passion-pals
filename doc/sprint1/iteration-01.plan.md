* This artifact facilitates efficient task allocation, collaboration, and progress monitoring, ultimately helping the team stay organized and meet project milestones.

Discord:
* Discord allows instant messaging and voice chats which makes a great environment for standup meetings, as it enables effective communication within the team.
* It can be used for quick discussions, clarifications, and for sharing important updates or announcements.
* This artifact fosters a collaborative environment, promotes transparency, and ensures everyone is aware of the current state of tasks and the project as a whole.


## Product


#### Goals and tasks


Our goal for this iteration is to have a functioning website that can interact with the database. It does not need to have its front end complete, but we are aiming to be able to log in, sign up, view profile, edit profile and create events.


#### Artifacts


The artifact we will produce to present our project idea is a functioning website. The website server will be hosted locally, and be able to connect to our online database so that users can use the website to login, signup, and create events.
