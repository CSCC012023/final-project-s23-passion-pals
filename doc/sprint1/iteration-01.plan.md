#### Artifacts


List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       


We will be keeping track of tasks using Jira for user stories and discord messages/standups for what tasks have been and need to be done. Task prioritization is based on what we as a group agree to complete first. The team together will decide who will do which tasks based on what is needed and how comfortable each member is with each task.


## Product


#### Goals and tasks


Our goal for this iteration is to have a functioning website that can interact with the database. It does not need to have its front end complete, but we are aiming to be able to log in, sign up, view profile, edit profile and create events.


#### Artifacts


The artifact we will produce to present our project idea is a functioning website. The website server will be hosted locally, and be able to connect to our online database so that users can use the website to login, signup, and create events.
