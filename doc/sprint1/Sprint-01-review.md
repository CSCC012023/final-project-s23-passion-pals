# PASSION PALS


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect


 * When: June 16 2023 
 * Where: Online


## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well


1. Create a discord server
* It helped us have better communication as a group since none of us particularly use Slack.
* Slack won’t let us do stand up calls with more than 2 people so discord works as a substitute
* We were able to keep track of what we were all doing even if we couldn’t find a good time to meet together using different channels in our server to update on progress with different features
2. Creating branches on GitHub for different components
* Helped groups to coordinate better without needing to worry about unknown commits.
3. Dividing up into groups for the components
* Allowed us to work on specific features with support from group members without having too much input from too many people to slow it down
4. Dividing into front and backend for the first sprint
* Since we are all new to web development, this allowed us to focus on learning specific new technologies we need for this first sprint rather than everything we’ll need for the project
* We will switch/move towards full stack in the following sprints




#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped


List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


1.  Excessive use of GitHub branches for development
* Since all of us were fairly inexperienced with Git version control, we went overboard with creating branches for every small task or bug fix and not regularly merging into dev
* This led to a complex branch hierarchy and difficulty in tracking changes across different branches
* Recognizing the challenges and inefficiencies caused by this approach, we have decided to clean out all the unnecessary branches before starting Sprint 2
2. Daily standups
* We were all individually quite busy for this sprint so we found difficult to find times where we could all meet at once
* Also sometimes unnecessary since only a couple or none of us did anything major.
* Discord still helped us keep track of everyone’s progress though still and we will try to aim for standups every 2-3 days instead for the foreseeable future.
3. Jira
* We all forgot to update it after the initial planning meeting.


#### Planned changes


* Going forward, we will adopt a more disciplined approach to branching, focusing on maintaining a manageable number of branches and adhering to best practices. This will help us maximize the benefits of version control while minimizing complexity and merging conflicts.
* Standups every 2-3 days instead like mentioned above.
* Either switching development rolls next sprint or moving towards everyone doing full stack
* Update Jira better going forward


## Product - Review


#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:


* Completed login and signup backend
* Completed login and signup frontend
* Completed view profile and edit profile backend
* Completed a basic view profile and edit profile frontend
* Completed backend for view event page
* Completed basic frontend for create event page


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:


* Backend for create event page was not met, and this was due to us just not getting to it


## Meeting Highlights


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:


1. Enhance user profile pages with additional information:
We have decided to add more user information, such as interests, themes, location, and friends, to the profile pages. This decision aims to improve the overall design and completeness of the profiles. By incorporating these details, we can create well-polished profile pages that provide a comprehensive view of each user. This will not only enhance the user experience but also allow for better connections and interactions within the platform.


2. Backend implementation for the create event page:
As part of our development roadmap, we are prioritizing the implementation of the backend functionality for the create event page. This decision ensures that when a user creates an event, it will be seamlessly displayed in the event feed. By implementing the necessary backend logic, we can enable users to share their events with the community, fostering engagement and participation. This feature will enhance the platform's functionality and provide users with a smooth and intuitive event creation process.


3. Integration of a user calendar displaying planned event dates:
Another important decision is to implement a calendar feature that showcases the dates on which a user has events planned. By integrating a calendar view into the user interface, we can provide users with a clear and organized overview of their scheduled events. This calendar will not only help users manage their commitments effectively but also serve as a convenient reference for planning and coordination. The implementation of this feature will greatly enhance the platform's usability and empower users to stay organized and engaged with their events.


4. GitHub branching:
As mentioned above to help us organize the components we are developing better. We got lucky this sprint in that we were all mostly making new files, so there were no merge conflicts.
